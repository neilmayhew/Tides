limit 40 out of 82 constituents, max dropped amp 0.0198, total 0.3626

The harmonic constants used to perform tide predictions for locations
in the U.K. are derived from sea level data obtained from the British
Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) based at the Proudman Oceanographic
Laboratory, Liverpool.  The predictions are not the same as those
computed by the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, which uses its own
sets of harmonic constants.

The data were supplied by the British Oceanographic Data Centre as
part of the function of the National Tidal & Sea Level Facility,
hosted by the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory and funded by the
Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and the Natural
Environment Research Council.
